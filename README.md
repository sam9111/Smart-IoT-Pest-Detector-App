This React Native app is one of the internally funded initiatives by SSN, receiving a grant from the institution to develop a SMART IOT-BASED PEST DETECTOR AND SPRAYER. The primary objective of this application is to provide users with remote control capabilities for a robot and sprayer, along with real-time access to the robot's camera feed.
